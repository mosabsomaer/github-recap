# GitHub Personal Access Token
# IMPORTANT: For fair and unbiased analysis, create a NEW GitHub account
# and use its token. This ensures:
# - You only see public data (no private repos)
# - No advantage from accessing colleagues' private repositories
# - Same data visibility as all other users in the analysis
#
# Token Permissions Required:
# - public_repo (read public repositories)
# - read:user (read user profile data)
#
# How to create:
# 1. Create a new GitHub account (e.g., github-recap-bot)
# 2. Go to Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
# 3. Generate new token with 'public_repo' and 'read:user' scopes only
# 4. Copy the token and paste it below
#
